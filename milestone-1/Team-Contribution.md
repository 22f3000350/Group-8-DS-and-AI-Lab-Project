For Milestone 1, I was primarily responsible for preparing and structuring the report components. My contributions include:
- Drafting and refining the Problem Definition and Objectives sections.
- Conducting the literature review on deep learning-based crop disease detection, disease severity estimation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multilingual NLP models, and speech systems.
- Identifying relevant benchmark datasets and reported performance metrics from prior research.
- Designing the Baseline Metrics and Evaluation Strategy with realistic numerical targets and robustness evaluation criteria.
- Developing the Gap Analysis section by mapping technical limitations to specific implementation strategies in our proposed system.
- Defining the disease scope (Rice Leaf Blight, Wheat Rust, Potato Early Blight, Corn Leaf Spot) and justifying their selection.
- Ensuring overall report coherence, technical clarity, and proper academic citation formatting.

For Milestone 1, I took responsibility for conceptualizing and developing the presentation framework that effectively communicates our project’s research direction and technical foundation. My contributions include:
- Structuring the slide flow to present the problem, motivation, objectives, and proposed solution in a clear and logical progression.
- Translating detailed report content into concise, impactful presentation material suitable for academic evaluation.
- Designing and organizing the system architecture slide to visually represent the integration of computer vision, RAG-based advisory, multilingual NLP, and speech modules.
- Highlighting the novelty of the proposed multimodal approach compared to existing solutions.
- Summarizing key literature insights into clear technical layers for better understanding.
- Presenting the evaluation methodology with measurable performance indicators and realistic targets.
- Ensuring visual clarity, consistency, and technical accuracy throughout the presentation.
- Aligning the PPT content with Milestone 1 expectations while maintaining professional academic standards.

For Milestone 1, I was primarily responsible for researching and writing the section on Indian startups working in the agri-AI domain. My contributions include:
- Identifying and selecting relevant Indian startups aligned with our project focus on crop disease detection, AI-based advisory, and multilingual interaction (e.g., KissanAI, Agent Crop, Fyllo, Farmonaut).
- Studying each startup's offerings, technologies used, and real-world impact by reviewing product documentation, websites, and news articles.
- Writing structured analyses for each startup, including what they do, how they relate to our system, and their limitations in comparison to our proposed approach.
- Highlighting specific technical gaps in existing solutions (e.g., lack of multimodal integration, limited conversational AI, absence of image+voice systems).
